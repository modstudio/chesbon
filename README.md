# Non-Profit Accounting Application 

## Project Background

### Introduction
This is a basic CRUD application, itâ€™s function is to manage causes, pledges and record transactions for a nonprofit organization. Plus some other useful features.

### Quick Overview
- The user can add Contacts and Categories and Transactions.
- Categories are Causes, Pledges, Loans (loans given), Pikadon (loans taken, typically this is money loaned to the organization by a donor that has extra cash in place of keeping in a savings account).
- Contacts and Categories are relational. For example, a Pledge can be made by a Contact for a Cause.  
- Records are added to the Register for any of Category (record details are Catagory specific so that the user can record relevant info for that Catagory type).
- We can then get a sum for each Category by adding all the line items for a given Category.

### Features 
- Search & Filter
- Transfers
- Reports and Metrics
- Active/Inactive

### Tech stack 
- Since this application will need to run on a Windows computer that does not have internet, Electron has been chosen. With Electron we can publish the app as a cross-platform application that can be installed on a Windows or Mac machine. 

### Authentication and users 
- This app is intended for use by a single user, user accounts, authentication, and user settings are not needed.
